Static Template Files
=====================

The text files in the "et-demands\\static" folder are templates of the static input files needed for running ET-Demands.  The files are tab delimited and the structure and naming mimic the Excel file used to control the VB version of the ET-Demands model.  The file "et-demands\\static\\TemplateMetAndDepletionNodes.xlsx" is an example of the Excel control file.

The template files should not be modified directly.  Instead, the prep tools workflow should be used to automatically populate the files or the files can copied to a "project\\static" folder and the values set manually.
